# ConfigManager Branding Prompts

**For DALL-E 3 Image Generation**

These prompts generate consistent branding for ConfigManager following the Beacon HQ Visual System v1.

---

## PROMPT 1: Title Card (16:9 Landscape)

```
Create a title card image with a 16:9 aspect ratio in a professional tech style with a dark background (#0a0e27 navy).

The main visual should feature a centralized configuration dashboard or control panel with interconnected settings. Show glowing configuration nodes, settings panels, path directories, and connection lines linking everything together. Include visual elements like gear icons, directory trees, agent profiles in a unified interface, and configuration files.

Include the text "ConfigManager" in a modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Inter) in bright cyan (#00d4ff), positioned in the lower third. Add the tagline "Centralized Configuration System" in smaller white text below it.

Use a color palette of navy blue (#0a0e27), bright cyan (#00d4ff), white (#ffffff), and accent colors for different config types (purple #a855f7 for paths, blue #60a5fa for agents, green #4ade80 for settings). Add subtle tech elements like directory structures, configuration panels, connection lines, and a slight grid pattern overlay.

The overall mood should be centralized, organized, and unified - conveying single source of truth for all configuration.
```

## PROMPT 2: Logo Mark (1:1 Square)

```
Create a square logo icon for a centralized configuration system called ConfigManager.

The design should feature a stylized gear or settings icon merged with a centralized hub. Use a dark navy circle (#0a0e27) as the background. In the center, show a minimalist representation of a gear or cog with connection points radiating outward to smaller nodes, representing centralized configuration.

Use bright cyan (#00d4ff) for the main gear/hub, with small colored nodes at the connection points (purple, blue, green) representing different configuration types (paths, agents, settings). Add a subtle glow effect around the central hub.

The style should be modern, clean, and tech-forward - suitable for a professional configuration tool. No text in this version - icon only.
```

---

## PROMPT 3: Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide)

```
Create a wide horizontal logo banner (3:1 aspect ratio) for ConfigManager.

On the left third, include a stylized icon of a gear or settings symbol with connection lines radiating to smaller nodes, representing centralized configuration management.

In the center and right sections, display "ConfigManager" in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Space Grotesk) in bright cyan (#00d4ff).

Use a dark navy background (#0a0e27) with subtle tech elements like configuration panels, directory structures, or connection lines flowing through the design. The gear icon should have a slight glow effect in cyan.

Below or integrated with the text, add small colored indicators for the three config types (purple for paths, blue for agents, green for settings) to reinforce the "centralized configuration" concept.

Professional, clean, tech-forward style suitable for GitHub headers and documentation.
```

## PROMPT 4: App Icon (1:1 Square, Simplified)

```
Create a simple, bold app icon (1:1 square) for ConfigManager that works at small sizes.

Design a minimalist icon featuring a gear or settings symbol. Use a dark navy (#0a0e27) to bright cyan (#00d4ff) gradient as the background. The main symbol should be a simple, geometric gear with 6-8 teeth, or a wrench/screwdriver crossed tools symbol.

Use white for the main icon elements with small accent dots in configuration colors (purple, blue, green) around or on the gear, representing different configuration aspects.

Keep it very simple and bold - it should be recognizable even at 32x32 pixels. Modern, flat design style with subtle depth (maybe a slight shadow or gradient).

No text - icon only. Clean, professional, instantly recognizable as a configuration/settings tool.
```
